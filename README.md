## Hi, I'm Andrew, but everyone calls me Silk. 
### A bit about me:

- :man_student: Iâ€™m currently finishing my BS in Software Dev (Winter 2023) and finding my next engineering gig. (If you have any leads, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://silkroski.com). Between my college experience with [WGU](https://www.WGU.edu) and my on-the-job learning at [Transparent Systems](https://www.transparent.us), plus jumping on other random projects, it's been a challenging but very fun journey.
- :beers: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that has something to teach me and gives me and opportunity to grow myself and improve what I'm working on.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning more languages (though I definitely want to also keep honing my C# and Rust skills)- Swift looks neat, and it seems like every job wants Python/Go these days.
- **This means you can ask me to join in on stuff, or if something on here catches your eye, submit a PR. _Let's do this thing!_**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about tabletop RPGs (5e, Genesys, PbtA), football coaching theory (offensive playcalling), and my award-winning rap skills.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Discord](https://www.discord.gg) is usually the best: silkmonkey or silkmonkey#0001, I never know anymore. [Email](mailto:andrew@appearslegit.com) can work in a pinch as well.
- :rainbow_flag: Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I collect TLDs; my favorite is... [appearslegit.com](https://www.appearslegit.com).
